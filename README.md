# Forage - Tata: Data Visualisation
Portfolio of work from the Tata Data Visualisation Virtual Internship Program via Forage.

## Task 1: Framing the Business Scenario

* Familiarize yourself with the client brief and data set.
* Draft 8 questions that would be relevant for the CEO & CMO.

An online retail store has hired me as a consultant to review their data and provide valuable insights from both an operations and marketing perspective. To prepare for a meeting with the CEO and CMO, I have drafted 8 questions (4 for each) that would be relevant to each individual. Looking through the data set, I identified invoice information (invoice number, date), product information (stockcode, description, quantity per invoice, unit price) and, customer information (country, id), as well as quantitative (date, quantity per invoice, unit price) vs. qualitative (invoice number, stockcode, product description, customer id, country) information. I was then able to indentify which KPI's could be derived from this data and which would be pertinent to operations vs. marketing.
