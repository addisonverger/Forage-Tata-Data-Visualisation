# Forage - Tata: Data Visualisation
Portfolio of work from the Tata Data Visualisation Virtual Internship Program via Forage.

## Task 1: Framing the Business Scenario

* Familiarize yourself with the client brief and data set.
* Draft 8 questions that would be relevant for the CEO & CMO.

An online retail store has hired me as a consultant to review their data and provide valuable insights from both an operations and marketing perspective. To prepare for a meeting with the CEO and CMO, I have drafted 8 questions (4 for each) that would be relevant to each individual. Looking through the data set, I identified invoice information (invoice number, date), product information (stockcode, description, quantity per invoice, unit price) and, customer information (country, id), as well as quantitative (date, quantity per invoice, unit price) vs. qualitative (invoice number, stockcode, product description, customer id, country) information. I was then able to indentify which KPI's could be derived from this data and which would be pertinent to operations vs. marketing.

## Task 2: Choosing the Right Visuals

* Select the appropriate visual representation based on the metrics/scenario provided.

The CEO & CMO have tasked me with creating visuals for the metrics the online retail store would like to analyze. Given visual requests by the CEO, I need to determine which type of visualization will be the most effective to illustrate the scenario. In answering these questions, I considered what types of data would make up the graphic, which metrics would need to be represented, and whatever additional requests the CEO had for the visualizations.

## Task 3: Creating Effective Visuals

* Create 4 visualisations based on questions that the CEO & CMO have requested.

The CEO and CMO have finalized the requirements and would like me to provide them with some analysis and visuals that would help answer their questions. The executives want to analyse the trends and the breakdown by different categories so that they have clarity on how the revenue is being generated and what are the main factors affecting the online store. Utilizing the preliminary work from Task 1 and 2, I created my visualizations for each given scenaro using Tableau. I performed data cleaning on the data set using calculated field filters within Tableau to exclude those quantities below 1 and prices below 0.

## Task 4: Communicating Insights and Analysis

* Create and record a presentation to the CEO & CMO using the visuals created in Task 3.
